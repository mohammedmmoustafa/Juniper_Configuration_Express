# The media (AKA interface) MTU size used on a physical interface (IFD) depends on the encapsulation used on that interface. In case of Ethernet interface, the media/interface MTU includes the L2 encapsulation overhead (excluding the CRC/FCS), i.e. 14 bytes (untagged), 18 (single tagged) or 22 (double tagged).
 
# flexible-vlan-tagging (recommended to be used on all network Ethernet interfaces; supporting untagged/single/double tagged) always assumes 22 bytes layer 2 overhead.
 
# inet/inet6 MTU describes the size of the full IP packet (including the IP header but excluding any L2 headers), i.e. inet/inet6 MTU = media/interface MTU - L2 encapsulation overhead.
 
# Increasing the inet MTU on core interfaces is mainly beneficial for BGP convergence (BGP update packet can go up to 4096 bytes as per RFC 4271) and for IP services that flow as unlabeled packets over the network backbone.
 
# ISO MTU is the size of the CLNS payload (commonly IS-IS LSP), i.e. ISO MTU = media/interface MTU - L2 encapsulation overhead - 3 bytes LLC header.
 
# If we try to configure an ISO MTU without subtracting the 3 bytes LLC header we will get a commit error.
  
# MPLS MTU calculation depends:
# When only media/interface MTU is tuned (implicit MPLS MTU), MPLS MTU = Interface MTU - L2 Overhead - maximum-labels (3x4 by default), i.e. MPLS MTU = MPLS Payload only.
# When MPLS MTU is tuned (explicit MPLS MTU), a flag “Flags: User-MTU” can be seen in the output of show interfaces, and MPLS MTU = Interface MTU - L2 Overhead, i.e. MPLS MTU = MPLS Header + MPLS Payload (similar to how inet MTU works, i.e. includes both header and payload).
 
# In all cases the maximum-labels (defaults to 3 in current codes, and can be set manually to 5) is always used to calculate the MPLS header and is enforced on the forwarding plane.
 
# In case of MPLS payload, i.e. labeled packets (MPLS service; L3VPN, L2VPN, etc.), only Interface/MPLS MTU is relevant on core interfaces, inet MTU is irrelevant on core interfaces (would be only relevant for IP (unlabeled packets, i.e. IGP routed packets, etc.), however media/interface MTU and inet MTU are relevant on access/service interface in this case, since any encapsulation overhead should be considered, for example, in case of eNodeB facing access interface, GTP and IPsec overhead should be considered on the inet MTU level of the access interface.
